# cli-validation
Library which contains help validators for use with the flag validation feature of urfave/cli(current for v3 only). Validation in urfave/cli is run only after the value has been converted from a string to the flag value type. So these validators need to focus only on validating the value, whether it be within a certain range or picked from a fixed number of values. For slice/map flags validation cannot be used to ensure that the underlying structure is of a certain length(s) since the final slice/map len can be known only after all the flags have been parsed. That kind of validation is a candidate for a Flag Action since those actions are run after all flags have been parsed
